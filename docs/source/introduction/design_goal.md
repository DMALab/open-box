# Design Goal

OpenBoxâ€™s design satisfies the following desiderata:
+ **Ease of use**. Minimal user effort, and user-friendly visualization
for tracking and managing BBO tasks.
+ **Consistent performance**. Host state-of-the-art optimization
algorithms; choose the proper algorithm automatically.
+ **Resource-aware management**. Give cost-model based advice
to users, e.g., minimal workers or time-budget.
+ **Scalability**. Scale to dimensions on the number of input variables,
objectives, tasks, trials, and parallel evaluations.
+ **High efficiency**. Effective use of parallel resources, system
optimization with transfer-learning and multi-fidelities, etc.
+ **Fault tolerance**, **extensibility**, and **data privacy protection**.

OpenBox: 高效通用的黑盒优化系统
================================================================

**OpenBox** is an open-source system designed for black-box
optimization. Based on Bayesian optimization, OpenBox can solve
black-box optimization problems efficiently. It supports not only
traditional single objective black-box optimization problems (e.g.,
hyperparameter optimization), but also multi-objective optimization,
optimization with constraints, multiple parameter types, transfer
learning, distributed parallel evaluation, multi-fidelity optimization,
etc. Moreover, OpenBox provides both standalone local usage and online
optimization service. Users can monitor and manage the optimization
tasks on web pages, and also deploy their private optimization service.
